# Changelog

## 0.1.1

- Fixed existing-project `aiplus install codex` upgrades so old AiPlus managed
  files are backed up and refreshed without requiring ordinary users to know
  `--force --backup --yes`.
- Preserved existing `.codex/compact/` state during install/upgrade.
- Updated generated refresh guidance so `刷新` and `refresh` are treated as
  AiPlus refresh first, with a concise installed-status response.
- Refined Auto Compact checkpoint/resume and Auto Team Consultant activation
  guidance in generated project instructions and bundled module docs.
- Kept the v0.1.1 installer on the verified macOS Apple Silicon release asset
  path with checksum verification and user-level `~/.local/bin/aiplus` install.

## 0.1.0

- Published v0.1.0 as the first practical binary-installed AiPlus CLI release.
- Added `install.sh` for checksum-verified user-level install to
  `~/.local/bin/aiplus`.
- Documented best-effort automatic compact resume behavior and natural
  continuation phrases.
- Rewrote public README and README.zh-CN beginner flow to use copy-pasteable
  installer commands instead of source-build placeholders.
- Standardized human-facing product naming to `AiPlus` while keeping the
  command, binary, repo, and crate identifiers as `aiplus`/`aiplus-cli`.
- Added an Owner-approved v0.1.0 GitHub Release path with a verified macOS Apple
  Silicon binary, `checksums.txt`, and checksum-verifying install script.
- Added Rust-first `aiplus` CLI workspace.
- Added local vendored AiPlus module asset snapshot.

  `COMPACT_RUST_NATIVE_STATUS=PASS`.

  platforms planned.
